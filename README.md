# Blog-Sphere

**Blog-Sphere** is a full-stack blog application built using **React** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend. The platform allows users to create, manage, and explore blogs with support for both **public** and **private** posts.

This project was developed to gain hands-on experience with Spring Security, CRUD operations, authentication handling, API integration, and responsive frontend design. It also serves as a learning ground for building secure, real-world web applications using modern technologies.

Key features include:

* User registration and login
* Role-based access for private blogs
* Blog creation, editing, and deletion
* Clean and responsive UI using modern styling techniques
* Integration of React with Spring Boot APIs
